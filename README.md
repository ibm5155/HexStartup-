WHERE's MT2D?
And ofc, you need this project in order to compile: https://github.com/ibm5155/MT2D (it should be easy to build for ms-dos and windows, for linux it's a bit of a mess, but it should be working if you build it with SDL support).
No mac support because, I never tested mt2d on mac :( (It shouldn't compile because of the ifdev guys)
